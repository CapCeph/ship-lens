STAR CITIZEN FANKIT LOGO PLACEMENT
===================================

To add the official "Made By The Community" logo:

1. Download the Star Citizen Fan Kit from:
   https://robertsspaceindustries.com/fankit

2. Extract the fankit and locate the "Made By The Community" logo
   (usually found in a logos or branding folder)

3. Copy the logo image to this directory and rename it to:
   made-by-community.png

4. Rebuild the application with: cargo tauri build

The logo will then appear in the community attribution section
of the app's center panel.

Per RSI guidelines, the logo must be:
- At least 50% opacity (we use 85%)
- Legible size (we use max-width 180px)
- Prominently placed (center panel)
