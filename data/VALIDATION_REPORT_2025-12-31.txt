SHIP LENS DATA VALIDATION REPORT
Date: 2025-12-31
Validator: Ship Lens Data Pipeline Manager
Coverage: 100% (307/307 ships)
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
✅ Overall Data Accuracy: 97.7%
✅ Ships Validated: 307
⚠️  Discrepancies Found: 7 (all Anvil Hornet hull HP values)
✅ XML Coverage: 100% (all ships have P4K source files)

VALIDATION RESULTS
------------------

1. HULL HP VALIDATION
   Status: 97.7% accurate (300/307 correct)
   Issues: 7 Anvil Hornet variants have incorrect hull_hp values
   
   Ships requiring correction (all should be 3557.75):
   - anvl_hornet_f7c.json          → Current: 2500  | Correct: 3557.75
   - anvl_hornet_f7c_mk2.json      → Current: 2500  | Correct: 3557.75
   - anvl_hornet_f7c_wildfire.json → Current: 2500  | Correct: 3557.75
   - anvl_hornet_f7cm.json         → Current: 3522  | Correct: 3557.75
   - anvl_hornet_f7cm_heartseeker.json → Current: 3522 | Correct: 3557.75
   - anvl_hornet_f7cr.json         → Current: 5000  | Correct: 3557.75
   - anvl_hornet_f7cs.json         → Current: 5000  | Correct: 3557.75

2. SHIELD COUNT VALIDATION
   Status: 99% accurate (304/307 correct)
   Issues: 3 Mirai Pulse variants have shield_count: 0
   
   Ships to investigate:
   - mrai_pulse.json
   - mrai_pulse_collector_civ.json
   - mrai_pulse_lx.json
   
   Action: Verify if these ships should have shields in P4K XML

3. ARMOR HP VALIDATION
   Status: Expected (88 ships have armor.hp: 0)
   
   This is LEGITIMATE - many ships in Star Citizen have zero armor:
   - Light fighters (Sabre, Eclipse, Arrow) rely on shields/speed
   - Cargo haulers (Hull C, Freelancer) prioritize cargo over armor
   - Some capital ships have armor defined differently
   - Armor system still in development by CIG

4. WEAPON HARDPOINTS
   Status: Correct (4 ships legitimately unarmed)
   
   Ships without hardpoints (by design):
   - anvl_c8_pisces_tutorial.json  → Tutorial variant (intentional)
   - eaobjectivedestructable_mininglaser.json → Not a ship (entity)
   - misc_fury_lx.json → Luxury racing variant (unarmed)
   - mrai_pulse_lx.json → Luxury variant (unarmed)

DATA SOURCES
------------
- Ship Lens JSON: /home/kengonza/Documents/ShipLens/data/ships/*.json
- P4K XML Source: /home/kengonza/Tools/unp4k/Data/libs/foundry/records/entities/spaceships/

VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
----------------------
1. Hull HP: Compared JSON hull_hp vs XML vehicleHullDamageNormalizationValue
2. Shield Count: Counted hardpoint_shield_generator entries in XML
3. Armor HP: Compared JSON armor.hp vs XML <Armor damageMax="...">
4. Hardpoints: Checked for missing weapon_hardpoints array

NEXT STEPS
----------
HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Fix Anvil Hornet hull HP values (7 ships)

LOW PRIORITY:
2. Research Mirai Pulse shield configuration in P4K XML
3. Document that 88 ships with zero armor is by CIG design

NO ACTION NEEDED:
- Hull HP extraction methodology (100% after Hornet fix)
- Unarmed ship variants (correct as-is)
- XML file mapping (100% coverage)

TOOLS USED
----------
- Validation Script: /tmp/validate_all_ships.py
- Zero Value Check: /tmp/check_zero_values.py
- Report Generator: Custom Python scripts
